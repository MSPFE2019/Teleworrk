### How to Group Controls in Power Apps:

#### 1. **Select Multiple Controls**:
   - Begin by navigating to the screen that contains the controls you want to group.
   - To select multiple controls, hold down the **Shift** key (or the **Ctrl** key) on your keyboard and click on each control you want to include in the group.

#### 2. **Using the Right-Click Menu**:
   - After selecting the desired controls, right-click on one of them.
   - From the context menu that appears, select **Group**. This will create a group containing all the selected controls.

#### 3. **Using the Top Menu**:
   - With the controls selected, go to the top menu bar.
   - Click on **Home**.
   - From the **Home** ribbon, find and click on the **Group** button.

#### 4. **Naming Your Group**:
   - Once you've grouped your controls, it's a good practice to name the group to make it easily identifiable.
   - In the tree view on the left, find your newly created group. It will typically be named something generic, like "Group1".
   - Right-click on it and choose **Rename**. Give it a descriptive name that indicates its purpose or the controls it contains. For instance, if you grouped together elements of a header, you might name it "HeaderGroup".

#### 5. **Modifying Grouped Controls**:
   - You can move or resize the entire group by clicking on its border and dragging or by using the resize handles.
   - If you need to modify an individual control within the group, simply click on it within the group's boundary. This allows you to interact with the control as if it wasn't part of a group.
   - To ungroup, select the group, right-click, and choose **Ungroup** from the context menu or use the **Ungroup** button from the **Home** ribbon.

#### 6. **Using Groups for Visibility and More**:
   - With controls grouped together, you can easily apply shared properties to them. For example, if you want the grouped controls to appear or disappear based on a condition, you only need to adjust the **Visible** property of the entire group, not each individual control.
   - Similarly, you can set other shared properties like color, border, and more to the entire group.
